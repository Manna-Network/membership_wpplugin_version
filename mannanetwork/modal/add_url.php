       <div class="modalHeader"><h1 align="center">Thank You For Wanting To Add Your Link To Our Web Directory!</h1></div>
            <p align="left">Our web directory is one of a network of many on individually owned and operated websites that co-operate together to advertise each other's websites. So when we make this offer available to other webmasters (like yourself) to add your link it means your website will be advertised on the network as well as ours. It's a better way for us to help people find your website than what just our own site could provide you by itself.</p>
            <p  align="left">You can add your link absolutely free and with no obligation but there is so much more available that I would like to encourage you to keep reading a bit further before you go on to register and add your link information!   
         <p  align="left">First, your web site will be listed in the order that it was received (we don't attempt to "rank" sites as some services claim to be able to do). Instead, we offer you the opportunity to pay for a better position ahead of the earlier links and then use that payment as a way to compensate the member web site operators for contributing their web traffic to the network. Again, you can add your link for free but I wanted to mention this compensation system because after you add your link you can also add a web directory just like this to your own website for absolutely free too! After you do that you can start to earn something for contributing your own web traffic to our little co-operative as well.
<p  align="left">Second, the network uses a Bitcoin only based payment system and since Bitcoin is such a new Internet payment system we like to take this opportunity to prep you a little bit. Don't let the fact that you never heard of Bitcoin scare you because, remember, you can advertise for free (and just ignore all the Bitcoin related stuff). But we have also gone to great lengths to help educate you about Bitcoin and to provide you with free tools to become experienced with it. In fact, we even built a tool that will let you "pay" with a free test demo version of Bitcoin and move your link ahead of all the previous free links just for trying out and using the demo. 
<p  align="left">So now that you know that this great web directory is part of a bigger effort than just ourselves just click the "Get Your Link Now" button and you will be taken to the hub of the co-operative at BungeeBones.com to register, add your link and, hopefuly, add a web directory of your own to your website as well!
