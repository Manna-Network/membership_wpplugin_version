== Description ==
With this script you can make a complete (with categories, links and management) website directory for your own website and, from there, it will 1) Offer your visitors the opportunity to register, add their own website info and have their website link info displayed across the entire ad network and 2) Offer them access to this same script (or a Wordpress plugin) for their own website. 


 

== Installation ==
1. Download the script and upload it to your website.
2. Unzip the script at whatever level you wish (i.e. you can install it at root level provided there are no file/folder name conflicts with existing files/folders or, alternately you can install it in its own directory named whatever you like). 
3. Open the index.php page in a web browser (i.e. FireFox., Chrome, etc.). 


If you have any questions about installation email me at robert.r.lefebvre@gmail.com and I'll be glad to assist you.
