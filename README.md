# membership_wpplugin_version
The Wordpress Plugin version of the membership participation level


The "membership level" is the simplest and least resource intensive entry point to the income earning levels of The Manna Network. This WordPress Plugin Version is one of TWO membership level versions (the other version being a vanilla PHP Version for use on the any PHP website).

REQUIREMENTS: Wordpress, PHP.

This version (as well as ALL versions) requires that the user had already established an advertising (or a customer level) account in The Manna Network. IF you are a brand new Manna Network user who has not yet registered as an advertiser, you will need to register and can do so at any one of the MEMBER websites listed at https://Manna-Network.com/member-sites.php or at https://Manna-Network.cash/member-sites.php.

You will be prompted by the script (after installation) for a "link id" or "affiliate number" which are assigned to each website url advertised in the Manna Network. Whether you registered in the previous step or were already an advertiser, you can retrieve your website's link or affiliate number through the instructions during installation.
